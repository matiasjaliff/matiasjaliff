I am a developer and engineer passionate about the implementation of creative solutions.

I've been deeply interested in web development since I was a kid. After a big journey in the energy industry as engineer and project manager.

I always look for creative ideas, I admire the work of my colleagues and I pursue the simplest and smartest ways to solve problems. I find beauty in simplicity.

I can work both in the back-end and in the front-end. My core language is JavaScript / TypeScript. I am experienced in Express, Sequelize, Node, React and Redux, among others. I am a big fan of Next.js too.

**Skills:** HTML | CSS | JavaScript | TypeScript | React | Redux | Next | Node | Express | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Jest | Vitest | Postman

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web catalogue using Sanity as a headless CMS and Next.js for the frontend. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to deploy on AWS. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I coded my first line of JavaScript in 1998.

I am a developer and engineer passionate about the implementation of creative solutions.

I've been deeply interested in web development since I was a kid. After a big journey in the energy industry as engineer and project manager, It's been a while since I came back to my first love, again in the arena of development.

As a fan of art, I always look for creative ideas, I admire the work of my colleagues and I pursue the simplest and smartest ways to solve problems. I find beauty in simplicity.

I can work both in the back-end and in the front-end. My core language is JavaScript. I am experienced in Express, Sequelize, Node, React and Redux, among others. I plan to study TypeScript and Angular soon, and Python in the mid-term.

**Skills:** HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React | Redux | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Node | Express

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on refactoring my recent projects. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use some awesome CSS frameworks. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React, Express. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I coded my first line of JavaScript in 1998. Then I took a 22 years hiatus.
